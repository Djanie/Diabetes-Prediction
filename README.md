# Diabetes-Prediction
"A machine learning project to predict diabetes based on medical data

Description
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on their medical records. The model helps identify patterns in patient health data that are indicative of diabetes. It provides potential insights into key health indicators such as glucose levels, BMI, and age that contribute to the likelihood of diabetes diagnosis.

Significance
Diabetes is a growing health issue worldwide, and early prediction can significantly impact patient outcomes by enabling timely interventions. This project aims to explore how machine learning can help in the early detection of diabetes using predictive analytics, contributing to better healthcare solutions and preventive strategies.

 Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 75% using Logistic Regression.

The diabetes prediction model highlights several key health indicators that play a significant role in diabetes risk. Glucose levels are the most influential feature, with higher levels strongly linked to a higher likelihood of diabetes. BMI also stands out, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a healthy weight to reduce risk. Age is another critical factor, as the chances of developing diabetes increase with age, particularly after 50. Additionally, blood pressure contributes to the prediction, with elevated levels often associated with higher diabetes risk. These insights suggest that regularly monitoring glucose, maintaining a healthy BMI through diet and exercise, and managing blood pressure can help lower the risk of developing diabetes.
